

The BRENDA data required for the SimZyme script and associated parser is not 
included since this requires a license and cannot be freely distributed.  
It is compatible with a .txt file containing all BRENDA entries as downloaded 
from BRENDA in 2012, and also requires a .json file containing the BRENDA 
compounds name-SMILES associations (which is not distributable 
due to licensing concerns).  A .json with any inchis that may be required can be 
generated from the data file available for download at 
http://bkm-react.tu-bs.de/bkm/download/download.php.  
The mapping file is organized by chemistry type; knowing what type of chemistry 
you require is essential for selecting the partial EC designation from the 
mapping file to use as input in SimZyme.
